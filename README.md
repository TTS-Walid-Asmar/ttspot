Finish Homework, you only generated the model
You have Users with some of invitable built out
You need to get the controllers running for each one and then move on to courses. Once courses are done you can do lessons
After lessons you can do HW
After HW you can do sign up with Github
Users requesting to be part of a course instead of invite only

Finally create Rake Task to update active to false after the end date...Cron to run at 3 am or so every night
